## design

During the development of my web portfolio, I followed a structured process that involved planning, designing, and implementing the website. I started with research to understand what kind of portfolio websites are currently in trend and what features make them effective. Once I had a clear idea of what I wanted to achieve, I designed wireframes and mockups in my UX for the website using Adobe XD. After that, I got feedback from my peers and UX proff to implement in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

One of the main challenges I faced was making my website responsive to different screen sizes. Initially, I had trouble getting the layout to work correctly on smaller screens, but I overcame this by using media queries and experimenting with different breakpoints. I also faced challenges in getting certain features to work correctly, such as the Bootstrap dropdown and SwiperJS functionality. However, I was able to overcome these challenges by researching online, and reading documentation.

By creating my web portfolio, I learned a lot about web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned how to design user interfaces using Adobe XD and how to optimize websites for different screen sizes.
